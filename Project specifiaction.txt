Project  specification

I created a shopping website so customers can choose any product,look for the details and if they liked it they can put it in the cart, after choosing all the products they liked,
customers must open the shopping cart and see all their chosen products and choose the quantity they want.

I tried to work with all the functionalities of react that i saw during the course, i split the project into several components and i used react router.
I brought an API and consumed it with AXIOS, and to manipulate the data i used the most important javascript array methods.
